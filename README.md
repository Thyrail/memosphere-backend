# üåü MemoSphere Backend

The **MemoSphere Backend** is a server-side application built with **NestJS**. It provides APIs for managing diaries, authentication, and integrating **OpenAI** capabilities such as chat completions, image generation, and text-to-speech. This backend is designed to support the **MemoSphere application**, with additional updates and features planned for the future.

**MemoSphere Frontend** is still under development!

- **Effortless Setup:** Run docker compose up -d to pull and launch the entire application, including the backend and frontend.
- **Fully Integrated:** The application will be ready to use, with all services configured and running seamlessly.

Stay tuned for the official release and Docker Hub integration!
